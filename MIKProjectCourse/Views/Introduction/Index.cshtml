    <h1>Course Introduction </h1>
    <h2>See&Sharp your knowledge — an official beginner course where learning C# is fun, interactive, and an adventure.</h2>

    <p>
        In this course we are going to learn the basics of programming. Topics such as structured programming and object-oriented programming
        will be covered first. After that, we will take a look at web programming and how to create your first basic website.  
        The course uses Visual Studio Community 2022, which is explained in more detail in later chapters.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can take a look at the guide for clarifications and explanations regarding the course.  
        This page exists simply to motivate you and help you start your first programming lesson.
    </p>

    <p>
        For this course, you do not need any background knowledge. If you have some, that's a bonus.
        The course is aimed at all people aged 1 to infinity — maybe someday we will get a super baby
        who learns programming at the age of 1.
    </p>

    <p>
        On a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means absolute beginner and 10 means senior-level programmer,
        this course is made for people at level 1.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, if you have had programming lessons before, you can still use this course for free
        to catch up or to relearn things you may have forgotten.  
        So basically, it is aimed at complete beginners and as a refresher for newly started programmers.
    </p>

    <h2>Quick Note</h2>

    <p>
        From this course, you will not become a professional programmer.  
        The goal is simply to help you test the waters of programming and see whether you like it.  
        You will gain a basic understanding of structural programming, object-oriented programming,
        and web programming / web design.  
        This course is meant to get you into flow and motivate you to learn more.
