    This is the end of this course.

    There’s a strange kind of sadness here.<br />
    You reached the last page, and the lessons stop.
</p>

<p class="text-center mt-3">
    But what you feel is not loss — it’s growth.
</p>

<p class="text-center mt-4">
    Everything you learned here are <strong>building blocks</strong>.<br />
    Not finished knowledge. Not the full picture.<br />
    Just the foundation.

<p class="text-center mt-4">
    Real development doesn’t live inside one course.<br />
    It lives in curiosity, mistakes, late nights, broken builds,<br />
    and the moment when something finally works.
</p>

<p class="text-center mt-4">
    This journey is not over.<br />
    In reality — it has only just begun.
</p>

<p class="text-center mt-5">
    There are countless amazing courses, books, projects, and ideas ahead of you.<br />
    Explore them. Break things. Rebuild them better.
</p>

<p class="text-center mt-4 fw-bold">
    And most importantly — keep going.
