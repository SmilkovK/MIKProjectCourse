    <h2>📝 What Does This Section Cover?</h2>
    <p>
        This section is divided into two main parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Part 1:</strong> Learning the basics of .NET web programming (absolute beginner level).</li>
        <li><strong>Part 2:</strong> Moving into more advanced topics (still beginner-friendly, but slightly deeper).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        To put this into perspective, if we were to rank knowledge on a scale of 1–10:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Part 1:</strong> You start at level <strong>1</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Part 2:</strong> You’ll move up to about <strong>2.5 – 3</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💻 Tools You Will Need</h2>
    <p>
        In this course, we will be using <strong>Visual Studio 2022 (Community Edition)</strong>. 
        While you can use other IDEs, we highly recommend VS 2022 as it is the most beginner-friendly option.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> is also a great option, but in our opinion, Microsoft’s Visual Studio 2022 
        offers more pre-built classes and a UI that makes it easier for beginners to get started.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the time of writing this course, we will be using <strong>.NET 9</strong>. 
        We recommend you install and use the same version for consistency.
    </p>
