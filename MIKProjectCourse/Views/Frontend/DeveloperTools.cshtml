    <h1>Developer Tools</h1>

    <p>Most browsers have what are known as Developer Tools. These tools allow us to inspect an element on a page, see where that element lives within the HTML document, and see what CSS properties and values are being applied to it. Most of these tools also include a box model diagram to show the computed size of an element.</p>

    <p>To see the Developer Tools in Google Chrome, click "View" within the menu bar and navigate to "Developer" and then "Developer Tools." This loads a drawer at the bottom of the browser window that provides a handful of tools for inspecting our code.</p>

    <p>Clicking the magnifying glass at the bottom of this drawer enables us to hover over and then click on different elements on the page to review more information about them.</p>

    <p>After selecting an element, we'll see a handful of tabs on the right-hand side of the Elements panel within our Developer Tools. Selecting the "Computed" tab will show us a breakdown of the box model for our selected element.</p>

    <p>Play around with the Developer Tools, be it in Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, or other browsers; there is much to learn from looking at our code. I generally leave the Developer Tools open at all times when writing HTML and CSS. And I frequently inspect the code of other websites to see how they are built, too.</p>

    <p>The box model is one of the most confusing parts of learning how to write HTML and CSS. It is also one of the most powerful parts of HTML and CSS, and once we have it mastered, most everything else—like positioning content—will come to us fairly easily.</p>
